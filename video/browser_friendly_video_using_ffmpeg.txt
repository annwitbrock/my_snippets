To make video files all browsers like :
------------------------------

Go to https://www.ffmpeg.org/

(my local copy is in downloads> tools> ffmpeg )

In the extracted folder open a command prompt
Run the bat file to set the path

now use 
>ffmpeg -i input.3pg output.mp4
or
>ffmpeg -i input.3pg output.ogg

ogg is smaller than mp4 (both do audio too).

Still need to find a way to shrink or compress the video.
Maybe use matlab or maybe write appropriate equivalent functions in python.
Also want to find a way to filter the audio to remove background noise.


The video tag:

 <video width="800" height="480" controls="controls">
     <source src="image/small.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
     <source src="image/small.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
     Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
